# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
## Description
This is a collaboration project between Toluwani Ajibare and David John who are both students in the ALX Africa software engineering program.
This project is an introduction to sorting algorithms and Big O Notation. 
## Algorithms used
| Algorithm | Short Description
| --- | --- |
| Bubble Sort | Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
| Insertion Sort | Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
| Selection Sort | Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.
| Quick Sort | QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 
| Shell Sort | Shell sort is a sorting algorithm that is highly efficient and is based on the insertion sort algorithm. This algorithm avoids large shifts, as in insertion sort, where the smaller value is on the far right and must be moved to the far left.
| Cocktail Shaker Sort | Cocktail shaker sort is a slight variation of bubble sort. It differs in that instead of repeatedly passing through the list from bottom to top, it passes alternately from bottom to top and then from top to bottom.
| Counting Sort | Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (a kind of hashing). Then do some arithmetic operations to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.
| Merge Sort | Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.
| Heap Sort | Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to the selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. Repeat the same process for the remaining elements.
| Radix Sort | Radix Sort algorithm is a stable sorting subroutine-based integer sorting algorithm. It is a sorting algorithm that does not use comparisons to sort a collection of integers. It classifies keys based on individual digits with the same significant position and value.
| Bitonic Sort | Bitonic sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that can be run in parallel. It focuses on converting a random sequence of numbers into a bitonic sequence, one that monotonically increases, then decreases.
### Things to be learnt from the project
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
